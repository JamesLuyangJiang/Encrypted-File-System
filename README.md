*Copyright: Luyang Jiang, CS161 @ University of California, Berkeley*

- Constructed a local file system that supports multiuser password login, file storage, and file sharing based on given DataStore and KeyStore API, with support of UUID library from Google
- Designed efficient and IND-CPA secure storage scheme for both user data and file system
- Utilized AES-CTR symmetric encryption, HMAC and SHA-512 Hash function to ensure security of most data
- Established secure multi-level and multi-user file sharing system and access revoking scheme with usage of RSA public-key encryption and RSA digital signatures
